# Repository Guidelines

This is the repository for 10xCards, an Astro 6 SSR application utilizing React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and Supabase. It is configured for deployment to Cloudflare Workers.

## Hard Rules & Critical Instructions

- **No "use client"**: Do not include `"use client"` in React components. Extract hooks to `src/components/hooks/`.
- **Astro vs React**: Use Astro components for static content/layout; use React components only when interactivity is needed.
- **Tailwind merging**: Always use the `cn()` helper from `@/lib/utils` for conditional/merged classes; never concatenate class strings manually.
- **Supabase RLS**: All new Supabase tables in `supabase/migrations/` must have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with explicit per-operation policies.
- **Migration naming**: Use format `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql` in `supabase/migrations/`.
- **Secret variables**: Do not commit secrets. Use `.env` for local Node tasks and `.dev.vars` for Cloudflare local dev.

## Project Structure

- `src/pages/` - Server-rendered routes. API routes go under `src/pages/api/` and must export `const prerender = false`.
- `src/components/` - Astro components (static/layout) and React components (interactive).
- `src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components ("new-york" style). Install via `npx shadcn@latest add [name]`.
- `src/components/hooks/` - Place extracted React hooks here.
- `src/lib/` - Shared services and utilities (e.g. `@/lib/supabase.ts`).
- `src/lib/services/` - Place extracted business logic here.
- `src/types.ts` - Place shared TypeScript types (entities, DTOs) here.

## Development & Build Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start the local Astro dev server (Cloudflare workerd runtime).
- `npm run build` - Build the production bundle. Requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` env vars.
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build.
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` - Run ESLint checks or automatically fix lint issues.
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier (includes prettier-plugin-astro + prettier-plugin-tailwindcss).

Pre-commit hooks: husky + lint-staged runs `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}` and `prettier --write` (rules in `@.prettierrc.json`) on `*.{json,css,md}`.

## Coding Style & Conventions

- **Path Alias**: Import using the `@/*` alias pointing to `src/*` (see `@tsconfig.json`).
- **API Methods**: Export uppercase functions (e.g., `GET`, `POST`) from API endpoints; validate inputs using Zod.

## Architecture

Full server-side rendering (`output: "server"` in `@astro.config.mjs`). All pages are server-rendered by default.

### Auth flow

- `src/lib/supabase.ts` — Supabase SSR client using `@supabase/ssr` with cookie-based sessions. Uses `astro:env/server` for `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` (server-only secrets declared in `astro.config.mjs` `env.schema`).
- `src/middleware.ts` — runs on every request, resolves the current user, attaches to `context.locals.user`. Redirects unauthenticated users away from routes listed in `PROTECTED_ROUTES`.
- API endpoints: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`
- Auth pages: `src/pages/auth/{signin,signup,confirm-email}.astro`
- Protected page example: `src/pages/dashboard.astro`

## Environment

- Node.js v22.14.0 (see `.nvmrc`).
- Env vars: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY` (copy `.env.example` to `.env` for Node, or `.dev.vars` for Cloudflare local dev).
- Local Supabase: `npx supabase start` (requires Docker).
- Cloudflare local dev: secrets go in `.dev.vars` (gitignored).
- Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy` (requires Cloudflare account + `wrangler` auth).

## Commit & PR Guidelines

- **Commits**: Follow Conventional Commits format (e.g. `feat: add card handler`, `fix: auth redirect`).
- **CI Pipeline**: All PRs to `master` trigger `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running linting and building. Requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` repository secrets for the build step.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 3

Lesson 3 is about **hooks** — turning the quality gates from Lesson 1 and the tests from Lesson 2 into automatic, deterministic checks that fire while the agent works. A hook runs outside the model, so it survives context compression, instruction changes, and the model "forgetting". The payoff for agentic hooks specifically: a `PostToolUse` check can feed its result back into the agent's context, so the agent fixes trivial errors (formatting, a missing import, a wrong type) on its own in the next iteration instead of you discovering them minutes later.

```

        ▼

```

### Task Router — Which layer for this check

| You want to | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| React the instant the agent edits a file | A per-edit hook (`PostToolUse` matcher `Write\|Edit` in your AI coding assistant). Right for fast checks: lint/format, and scoped tests on risk-area files. This is the **only** layer that can hand feedback to the agent mid-session. |
| Run only the tests that depend on the edited file | Parse the path from the hook's stdin (`jq -r .tool_input.file_path`) and run your runner's related-tests mode (`vitest related "$FILE" --run`, `jest --findRelatedTests $FILE`). Gate it on whether the file is a risk area in `test-plan.md`; don't run tests on every helper or config edit. |
| Catch changes that bypassed the agent (manual edits, a teammate's commit) | A pre-commit git hook (Lefthook or Husky+lint-staged) over staged files: lint + typecheck, and tests on staged risk files. |
| Run heavier checks before code leaves the machine | Pre-push: full typecheck or a broader test set. Anything too slow for per-edit moves here. |
| Decide where a given gate belongs | Ask: is it fast enough (a few seconds) for per-edit, or should it wait for commit/push/CI? Slow checks block the agent loop on every edit — push them up a layer. |
| Use the same hook across tools | The trigger → matcher → handler → signal pattern is the same in Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, and Copilot; only the config file and event names change. See the cross-tool table below. |

### Hook lifecycle — the universal pattern

Every tool's hooks follow four steps:

1. **Trigger** — an event in the tool (e.g. the agent just saved a file: `PostToolUse`).
2. **Matcher** — a filter deciding whether this hook runs (tool name like `Write`/`Edit`, file type, or a name pattern).
3. **Handler** — the action that runs, usually a shell command.
4. **Signal** — the result returns to the tool. The exit code says pass/fail; stdout can flow into the agent's context as feedback.

### Exit codes and the feedback loop

- **0** — success; the hook passed, continue.
- **2** — blocking error; the agent sees the feedback and should react.
- **anything else** — non-blocking error; logged, but does not interrupt work.

On a blocking failure, stdout flows into the agent's context (in your AI coding assistant via `additionalContext`, capped at 10,000 characters; other tools have similar mechanisms with their own limits). That is why the agent can self-correct: it sees the concrete message — missing type, unimported module, badly formatted line — not just "something failed".

The boundary: the agent reliably fixes **trivial** corrections on its own. When a test fails because of wrong business logic, the hook surfaces it but the agent may not diagnose the real cause — it says "something is off" and tries a trivial fix. If that does not resolve in one or two tries, the signal comes back to you, and the problem may deserve its own change-id with the full `/10x-new → /10x-research → /10x-plan → /10x-implement` workflow.

### Three local layers (plus CI)

| Layer | Catches | Timing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-edit (agent hooks) | Formatting, simple type errors, failing unit tests on risk files. Only layer that feeds the agent mid-work. | ms–s |
| Pre-commit (git hooks) | What slipped past per-edit: manual edits, files changed outside the hook, checks too slow for per-edit. Operates on staged files. | s |
| Pre-push | Heavier checks before pushing to remote (full typecheck, broader test set). | s–min |
| CI | Integration problems, cross-module dependencies, checks needing infra unavailable locally. | min |

Local layers do **not** replace CI — CI stays the key verification for shared repo state and environments you don't control. But each local layer that catches an error is one fewer CI round-trip. You don't need all layers from day one: start with one per-edit hook (lint) and one commit gate, add layers as you see what escapes. The quality gates in `test-plan.md §4` decide which checks are worth automating and at which layer; a plan may legitimately defer per-edit hooks if the cost/signal ratio isn't there yet.

### Key rules

- Keep per-edit hooks fast. If a check takes more than a few seconds, move it to commit, push, or CI — a slow per-edit hook blocks the agent loop on every edit. Lint/format are ideal per-edit; full typecheck is often a commit gate in larger projects.
- Run scoped tests, not the whole suite, per edit — only tests related to the edited file, and only when that file is a risk area in `test-plan.md`.
- `related` is a subcommand, not a flag (`vitest related`, not `--related`). Use `--run` so the hook terminates instead of entering watch mode.
- `PostToolUse` fires once per tool use; three edits in one turn fire it three times independently — there is no built-in aggregation.
- The git hook tool (Lefthook vs Husky+lint-staged) is an implementation detail; the rule is the same — run checks on staged files before commit. If Husky already works, don't migrate.
- **Context injection is not universal.** Your AI coding assistant, Cursor, Codex, and Copilot (in VS Code) can pass a hook's result to the agent; Windsurf cannot — it can block (exit 2) but can't tell the agent what went wrong.

### The same pattern in every tool

| Tool | Events | Handlers | Context injection | Config |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Your AI coding assistant | ~30 | command, http, mcp_tool, prompt, agent | yes | `the AI tool's configuration directory/settings.json` |
| Cursor | ~18 | command, prompt | yes | `.cursor/hooks.json` |
| Codex | 10 | command | yes | `.codex/hooks.json` |
| Windsurf | 12 | command | **no** | `.windsurf/hooks.json` |
| Copilot | ~13 | command, http, prompt | yes (VS Code) | `.github/hooks/*.json` |

### Lesson boundaries

- This lesson configures hooks and local quality layers only. The hook JSON, `lefthook.yml`, and the per-edit/commit/push layering are the scope.
- Do not write E2E tests, configure Playwright/MCP, or run browser scenarios. That is Lesson 4.
- Do not run the bug-to-fix-to-regression-test debugging workflow. That is Lesson 5.
- Do not change the risk strategy or quality-gate definitions. That is Lesson 1 (`/10x-test-plan`); read current state with `/10x-test-plan --status`.
- Do not write unit/integration test code from scratch here. That is Lesson 2 — hooks only *run* the tests those lessons produced.
- Do not author CI/CD pipelines. That is Module 1 Lesson 5 / Module 2 Lesson 5; hooks are the local layers in front of CI.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `the AI tool's configuration directory/settings.json` — hook configuration (`~/.claude/settings.json` global, `the AI tool's configuration directory/settings.json` project, `the AI tool's configuration directory/settings.local.json` local overrides). Other tools use their own config file (see the table).
- `lefthook.yml` — pre-commit git hook config (lint + typecheck + tests on `{staged_files}`).
- `context/foundation/test-plan.md` — §4 quality gates decide which checks to automate and at which layer; risk areas decide which edits warrant scoped tests.
