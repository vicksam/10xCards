# Repository Guidelines

This is the repository for 10xCards, an Astro 6 SSR application utilizing React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, and Supabase. It is configured for deployment to Cloudflare Workers.

## Hard Rules & Critical Instructions

- **No "use client"**: Do not include `"use client"` in React components. Extract hooks to `src/components/hooks/`.
- **Astro vs React**: Use Astro components for static content/layout; use React components only when interactivity is needed.
- **Tailwind merging**: Always use the `cn()` helper from `@/lib/utils` for conditional/merged classes; never concatenate class strings manually.
- **Supabase RLS**: All new Supabase tables in `supabase/migrations/` must have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled with explicit per-operation policies.
- **Migration naming**: Use format `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql` in `supabase/migrations/`.
- **Secret variables**: Do not commit secrets. Use `.env` for local Node tasks and `.dev.vars` for Cloudflare local dev.

## Project Structure

- `src/pages/` - Server-rendered routes. API routes go under `src/pages/api/` and must export `const prerender = false`.
- `src/components/` - Astro components (static/layout) and React components (interactive).
- `src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components ("new-york" style). Install via `npx shadcn@latest add [name]`.
- `src/components/hooks/` - Place extracted React hooks here.
- `src/lib/` - Shared services and utilities (e.g. `@/lib/supabase.ts`).
- `src/lib/services/` - Place extracted business logic here.
- `src/types.ts` - Place shared TypeScript types (entities, DTOs) here.

## Development & Build Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start the local Astro dev server (Cloudflare workerd runtime).
- `npm run build` - Build the production bundle. Requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` env vars.
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build.
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` - Run ESLint checks or automatically fix lint issues.
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier (includes prettier-plugin-astro + prettier-plugin-tailwindcss).

Pre-commit hooks: husky + lint-staged runs `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}` and `prettier --write` (rules in `@.prettierrc.json`) on `*.{json,css,md}`.

## Coding Style & Conventions

- **Path Alias**: Import using the `@/*` alias pointing to `src/*` (see `@tsconfig.json`).
- **API Methods**: Export uppercase functions (e.g., `GET`, `POST`) from API endpoints; validate inputs using Zod.

## Architecture

Full server-side rendering (`output: "server"` in `@astro.config.mjs`). All pages are server-rendered by default.

### Auth flow

- `src/lib/supabase.ts` — Supabase SSR client using `@supabase/ssr` with cookie-based sessions. Uses `astro:env/server` for `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` (server-only secrets declared in `astro.config.mjs` `env.schema`).
- `src/middleware.ts` — runs on every request, resolves the current user, attaches to `context.locals.user`. Redirects unauthenticated users away from routes listed in `PROTECTED_ROUTES`.
- API endpoints: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`
- Auth pages: `src/pages/auth/{signin,signup,confirm-email}.astro`
- Protected page example: `src/pages/dashboard.astro`

## Environment

- Node.js v22.14.0 (see `.nvmrc`).
- Env vars: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY` (copy `.env.example` to `.env` for Node, or `.dev.vars` for Cloudflare local dev).
- Local Supabase: `npx supabase start` (requires Docker).
- Cloudflare local dev: secrets go in `.dev.vars` (gitignored).
- Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy` (requires Cloudflare account + `wrangler` auth).

## Commit & PR Guidelines

- **Commits**: Follow Conventional Commits format (e.g. `feat: add card handler`, `fix: auth redirect`).
- **CI Pipeline**: All PRs to `master` trigger `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running linting and building. Requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` repository secrets for the build step.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 1

Move from sprint-zero setup to project orchestration with the **roadmap chain**:

```
(Module 1 foundation docs) -> /10x-roadmap -> backlog-ready roadmap items
```

`/10x-roadmap` is the lesson focus. `/10x-new` is intentionally introduced in Module 2, Lesson 2, when a selected roadmap item becomes an implementation change folder.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Roadmap (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-roadmap` | You have `context/foundation/prd.md` and a scaffolded project baseline, and you need a vertical-first MVP roadmap. The skill reads the PRD, inspects the code baseline, uses available foundation docs such as `tech-stack.md`, `infrastructure.md`, and `deploy-plan.md`, then writes `context/foundation/roadmap.md`. Use it BEFORE creating per-change folders or implementation plans. |
| **Re-run upstream if needed** | |
| `/10x-shape` / `/10x-prd` / `/10x-tech-stack-selector` / `/10x-bootstrapper` / `/10x-agents-md` / `/10x-infra-research` | Bundled from Module 1 so foundation contracts can be fixed before roadmap sequencing. If roadmap generation exposes a PRD gap, repair the PRD before pretending the backlog is ready. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-roadmap` bridges product and implementation. It does not choose frameworks, design schemas, or write a per-change implementation plan.
- The output is `context/foundation/roadmap.md`: ordered milestones, vertical slices, bounded foundations, dependencies, unknowns, risk, and backlog handoff fields.
- Roadmap items should receive stable human-readable identifiers in backlog tools. The actual `context/changes/<change-id>/` folder is created in Lesson 2 with `/10x-new`.

### Roadmap boundaries

- Default to vertical slices: user-visible outcomes that cross UI, data, business logic, and integrations.
- Horizontal work is allowed only as a bounded enabler that names the downstream vertical milestone it unlocks.
- Avoid orphan horizontal work such as "build the whole database", "build all API endpoints", or "design the whole UI" before the first user-visible flow.
- Roadmap is not a calendar estimate. Do not invent dates, story points, or sprint velocity unless the user explicitly asks for a separate planning artifact.

### Foundation paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/prd.md` - input
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/infrastructure.md` - optional input
- `context/deployment/deploy-plan.md` - optional input
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` - output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` - load-bearing names registry

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
